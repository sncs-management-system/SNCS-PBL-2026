# SNCS Management System

This repository contains the Sto. Niño Catholic School (SNCS) management-system
project. This branch implements **PB-10: Public Website Content** and
**PB-11: Public Resource Downloads** as a responsive Vue.js single-page application.

## Technology alignment

The project follows the architecture proposed in the SSYSADD1 paper:

- **Frontend:** Vue 3, Vue Router, TypeScript, and Vite
- **Backend (future backlog):** Node.js with Express
- **Resource data and files:** Supabase PostgreSQL and Storage
- **Authentication (future backlog):** Express-managed authentication and sessions
- **Scheduling (future backlog):** a separate Python service using Google OR-Tools

The public frontend and Supabase resource reads/downloads are implemented.
Backend, staff authentication/CMS, enrollment and scheduling remain future work.

## PB-10 public website

- Responsive Home, About, Campus, News, Events, Contact, and Admissions routes
- Sourced school history, updated mission/vision, six core values, and separate motto
- Announcement details, date-range events with upcoming/past separation, and office contacts
- Optional announcement images with descriptive alternative text and full-size detail views
- Six applicant checklists and reusable student-service links
- Existing alumni sections preserved pending the client's decision
- SNCS red-and-gold visual identity derived from the existing website
- Typed, CMS-ready content models with publication-status and visibility controls
- Public-content selector tests that exclude draft, private, and archived records
- Philippine calendar-date tests for ongoing events and date ranges
- Publicly available campus images retained as temporary source-site assets

## Local development

Use Node.js 20.19+ (or 22.12+) and pnpm.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Quality checks:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

The Vite development server prints the local URL after it starts. For production,
configure the host to serve `index.html` as the fallback for Vue Router paths.

## Supabase setup for PB-11

Vercel and local environment configuration use `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and
`VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` for a new
checkout and use the Supabase project's public configuration values.

Run `pnpm check:supabase` for API/key connectivity, or `pnpm check:resources` for
read-only checks of the two published TLC records, original PDF hashes and
anonymous column restrictions. `/resources` groups live public/published PDFs
and starts downloads in two desktop clicks or three phone taps from Home.
See [the setup notes](docs/supabase-setup.md) and
[PB-11 implementation notes](docs/pb11-preparation.md) for applied migration,
seed and verification details.

## Content integration boundary

The implemented content batch follows the
[PB-10 content and design plan](docs/pb10-content-design-plan.md), with sources,
page layouts, CMS mapping, and a three-click task checklist. Local checks and
screenshots are recorded in [PB-10 verification](docs/verification/pb10-verification.md). See
[PB-11 implementation](docs/pb11-preparation.md) for the two published TLC PDFs
and download verification. Alumni remains on hold pending the client
decision; its existing markup and assets are unchanged.

Temporary content lives under `src/lib/content`. Components consume typed selector
functions rather than importing raw records directly. The future CMS adapter can
replace this data source while preserving the page components and enforcing the
same `published` and `public` visibility contract. This frontend filter is not a
database access policy: a future backend must return only public records and
enforce authorization before sending data to the browser. Resource reads already
use RLS and limited column grants. CMS editing screens, other Supabase content
adapters, and enrollment submission remain pending.

## Asset note

Images under `public/images/source-site` were obtained from the existing public
SNCS website for redesign prototyping. See
[`docs/brand-and-asset-audit.md`](docs/brand-and-asset-audit.md) for provenance and
replacement guidance. Client-approved original files should replace them before
production release.
